"****File PATH: (file path)****" - THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST LINE REGARDLESS OF THE ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I WANT IT EXACTLY LIKE THAT BUT REPLACE (file path) WITH THE ACTUAL FILE PATH!!!!!!!!!! - You can see this in the file structure from the module plan.

For the specified page, provide a highly detailed and comprehensive description of every function, component, and feature. Ensure alignment with visual and design principles from the module plan. Avoid redundancy and ensure clarity.

***Tech Stack***
React18 
You are a highly skilled frontend software developer with deep expertise in REACT and a strong focus on creating stunning, high-quality user interfaces.

**Detailed Implementation Instructions**:

1. **Thorough Analysis**:
   - **Review the `pagePlan`**: Understand the page’s purpose, user requirements, and context within the module.
   - **Identify Components and Functions**: Note all key components, functions, and design elements as outlined in the `pagePlan`.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Detailed Breakdown**: Implement each function with precision:
     - **Purpose**: Ensure each function serves its described purpose effectively.
     - **Inputs/Outputs**: Handle all inputs and outputs as specified, including validation and error handling.
     - **Logic**: Follow the processing logic provided in the `pagePlan`, incorporating all necessary steps.

3. **Component Development**:
   - **Implementation**: Build each component as per the `pagePlan`:
     - **Functionality**: Ensure the component performs its intended role and handles data and interactions as described.
     - **Layout**: Follow layout guidelines, including positioning, dimensions, and responsive design.

4. **CSS Styling and UI/UX Excellence**:
   - **Create CSS Files**: For each component, create a corresponding CSS file adhering to styling details in the `pagePlan`.
     - ***File Name***: [File Path E.g., src/Components/ComponentName.css]
       [CSS content]
   - **Adherence to `pagePlan`**: Ensure visual aspects like color schemes, typography, spacing, and responsiveness are precisely aligned with the `pagePlan`.
   - **Visual Design**: Enhance user experience with a visually appealing design that meets the `pagePlan` requirements.

5. **Integration and Testing**:
   - **Error-Free Code**: Ensure code is functional and error-free. Test components and functions to confirm they work as expected.
   - **Component Integration**: Ensure seamless integration of components and functions, maintaining proper data flow and interaction.

6. **Code Structure and Formatting**:
   - **Format and Presentation**: Structure your code as follows:
     - ***File Name***: [File Path E.g., src/Components/ComponentName.js]
       [Code content]
     - ***File Name***: [File Path E.g., src/Components/ComponentName.css]
       [CSS content]
   - **Exclusions**: **DO NOT** include `index.js` or `App.js` code. Focus solely on the components and functions specified.

7. **Review and Refinement**:
   - **Accuracy Check**: Review implementation to ensure it aligns with the `pagePlan`.
   - **Refinement**: Make necessary adjustments based on feedback or observations for full compliance with the `pagePlan`.

**Important Guidelines**:
- **Precision**: Every detail from the `pagePlan` must be accurately translated into code.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent coding and styling practices throughout the implementation.
- **Styling Compliance**: Ensure CSS styling is precisely according to the `pagePlan` to achieve the desired look and feel.

****PROVIDE ONLY THE CODE IN THE FORMAT ABOVE—NO ADDITIONAL TEXT OR EXPLANATIONS.****

ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING VERY CAREFULLY:

*Objective:* Enhance the functionality and efficiency of the provided React code to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability.

**Instructions:**

1. **Component Structure:**
   - Break down large components into smaller, reusable functional components.
   - Ensure that each component has a single responsibility to improve readability and testability.

2. **State Management:**
   - Optimize state management by lifting the state up where necessary and minimizing the use of global state.
   - Use React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useReducer` to manage state and side effects effectively.

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Identify and remove any unnecessary re-renders using `React.memo` and `useCallback`.
   - Lazy load components and assets where possible to improve load times and overall performance.
   - Implement code-splitting using React's `Suspense` and `lazy` for dynamic imports.

4. **Data Fetching and Error Handling:**
   - Use `useEffect` for data fetching with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
   - Implement centralized error handling and loading states to improve the user experience.

5. **Prop Drilling and Context Usage:**
   - Minimize prop drilling by utilizing React Context API where appropriate.
   - Ensure that context is used judiciously and doesn't lead to unnecessary complexity or re-renders.

6. **File Management:**
   - **Do not create any new files**. Only modify the existing ones.
   - **Return the file paths in the exact same format** as provided.

7. **Exclusions:**
   - **Do not modify `app.js`**.

**Output Format:**
- Provide the exact file paths and corresponding code content for each file.
- Use the following format strictly:

***File Name***: [File Path E.g src/Components/ComponentName.js]
[Code content here]

***File Name***: [File Path E.g src/page.js]
[Code content here]

   [EXACTLY THIS FORMAT - DO NOT CHANGE THE STRUCTURE - ONLY USE ***]
